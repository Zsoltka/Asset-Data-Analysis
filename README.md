## Data Cleansing

I obtained the data from Yahoo Finance, with data for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq available from January 1, 2000, Bitcoin (BTC) data from January 1, 2015, and Ethereum (ETH) data from December 1, 2017. My main task in Excel involved formatting the columns to ensure smooth integration into DB Beaver, enabling easy importation and analysis within the DB Beaver environment.

## Project summary

This project aims to uncover insights from the financial markets by exploring various aspects of the S&P500, NASDAQ, BTC, and ETH. By examining the data through different lenses â€“ temporal trends, market volatility, correlations between markets, and trading volume patterns.

## Questions to Answer

**1. Trend over time:** Generating a plot that illustrates the adjusted closing prices over time, offering a means to visualize the overall trends in each market.

**2. Market Volatility using Historical Returns::** Calculating monthly returns. Creating plot the over time. 

**3. Trading volume over time:** Generating a time-based plot to observe trends or anomalies in the trading volume.

**4. Asset analysis - Normal Distribution:** Comprehensive evaluation of financial assets statistical characteristics with the goal of understanding their behavior and the implications for investment decisions.

## Data analysis

**1. Trend over time:** Analyzing all four markets we can observe that we have a uptrend. Due to the fact that the crypto space is a new market, the market capital is smaller so the trendlines are more abrupted. If we analyze the trends in smaller time frames, we can see that generally these markets are moving in the same direction. In time of market growth the market are growing, in recession all markets are taking hits.
Crypto enthusiasts are saying that in recession BTC will behave like a save haven and despite of other markets fallings, BTC will grow. From 2020 until today we saw that this is not thru (for now). All markets have been taking hits because investors are turning to more secure investments.

Examining this chart, we gain valuable insights into market cycles and how markets have behaved over the last two decades. It allows us to pinpoint significant events such as financial crises, shifts in interest rates, the onset of pandemics and wars, as well as the emergence of new market booms that coincide with periods of growth.
<tr>This topic is extensive and could be explored further, but one thig is sure and that is that all markets are growing, they have an uptrend if we are analyzing a bigger timeframe.
